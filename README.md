# OSCE-WEB

this is my attemy to make an exam website
my goals are

1. store all available practice osces
2. be able to acess them as examiner or a candidate mode
3. be able to track performance over time
4. have a working area where a timer is present
5. make it able to add new cases rapidly

TO DO:
Needs proper server migration to be able to have a proper password protection service
Good to get it in a partial state though
